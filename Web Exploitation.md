##### Resources

How do 'Disallow' commands work in a robots.txt file?
The Disallow command is the most common in the robots exclusion protocol. It tells bots not to access the webpage or set of webpages that come after the command. Disallowed pages aren't necessarily "hidden" 
– they just aren't useful for the average Google or Bing user, so they aren't shown to them. Most of the time, a user on the website can still navigate to these pages if they know where to find them.
The Disallow command can be used in a number of ways, several of which are displayed in the example above.
