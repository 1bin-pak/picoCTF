#### Reference:
"In this program, integer overflow can occur if the sum of num1 and num2 is greater than the maximum value that can be represented by an int data type.

The maximum value that can be represented by a 32-bit signed int data type is 2,147,483,647. Therefore, if the sum of num1 and num2 is greater than 2,147,483,647, an integer overflow will occur." \

"A 32-bit integer limit allows for 4,294,967,296 (2^32) pieces of data. If storing signed integers, this would range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (2^32 / 2). This is a good time to consider what happens if a value exceeds the minimum or maximum"
